TODOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix grunt build issues with uglify!
  (Problem resists on the issue that grunt configuration is expecting on some point that script files are already
  being concated and made ready for ngmin and uglify processes, in the requirejs version of the app there is no need
  for multiple script loaders, so there should be a smart fix here..)

* Fix problems with e2e testing framework!

* Implement grunt-changelog plugin for dynamically produced changelog's

* Implement grunt-release plugin and streamline the release process

* Investigate more on yeoman generators

* Lose some weight on node modules if they are not used ;)

* Finalize Continuous Integration process and Dependency Checkers

* Try to implement Express-Routes stuff for dynamically creating back-end simulations during the development

* Probably cdfy grunt plugin not needed with requirejs stuff?

* Clean or leave coffeescript stuff?

* Clean or leave svgmin stuff?

* Clean or leave jshint stuff since I already use IDE's jshint and jslint functionality?

* Trim down grunt-concurrent stuff since not all of them are used now?

* Start with a project documentation
